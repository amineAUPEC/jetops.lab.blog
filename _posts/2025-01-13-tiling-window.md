# Best Tiled Window Manager for Windows?
### Best Tiled Window Manager for Windows?

![image-reddit](https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/renderTimingPixel.png)

[**App**](https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/search?q=flair_name%3A%22App%22&restrict_sr=1)

Linux has far too many options, but that doesn't help us too much, so I thought I'd make a thread of our own.

Does anyone have any recommendations, experience, or suggestions?

Wikipedia has a list of programs for windows [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager#Third-party_addons), which has been reproduced below.

- [AquaSnap](http://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap) — Tiles and arranges windows by "drag & drop" or hotkeys, can "snap" windows side by side like magnets. Supports multi-monitor setups
- [SplitView](http://www.splitview.com/) — Tiles windows using caption buttons and keyboard shortcuts, optionally maximizing windows to a screen part (commercial)
- [Mosaico](http://www.soulidstudio.com/) — Tiles windows using "drag&go" feature or keyboard shortcuts. Saves windows position and size in a snapshot and can restore up to 8 snapshots (commercial)
- [HashTWM](https://github.com/ZaneA/HashTWM) — Tiling window manager with automatic tiling
- [GridMove](http://jgpaiva.dcmembers.com/gridmove.html) — Tiles and arranges windows on sophisticated layouts with hotkeys and multi-monitor support
- [bug.n](https://github.com/fuhsjr00/bug.n) — Amongst other flavours is a dynamic, tiling window manager, which tries to clone the functionality of dwm
- [Windawesome](https://windawesome.codeplex.com/) — A highly customizable dynamic window manager written in C#
- [MaxTo](http://maxto.net/) — Tiles windows on user-defined grid by intercepting windows that are maximized or using hotkeys. Supports multi-monitor setups
- [Twinsplay](http://www.zinstall.com/products/twinsplay) — Tiles windows using keyboard shortcuts
- [Plumb](http://palatialsoftware.com/plumb) — Automatically aligns windows for you while you work
- [Python-windows-tiler](https://github.com/Tzbob/python-windows-tiler) — Very basic tiler
- [Divvy](http://mizage.com/divvy/) — (Commercial)

Edit: (5 years later) All these years later, it seems a little unnecessary, because Windows 10 has features very similar to AquaSnap built in, but I've ended up using two main things to organize my windows. **Microsoft Powertoys**, which has a great built-in manager, and [**Groupy**](https://www.stardock.com/products/groupy/), which takes a rather clever approach to window management.
