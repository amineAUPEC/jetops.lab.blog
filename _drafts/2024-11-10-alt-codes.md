"""

Go to Settings App - Ease of Access - Mouse
Check if this option is turned on - 'Use Mouse Keys when Numlock is on'
If it is, turn it off.

If this option is on it can disable the entering of Alt codes . . .

If that does not work:

To enable the entry of all Unicode characters by code:

Open Regedit (Windows + R Keys and enter regedit)

Navigate to this Key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Input Method 

Create a string value called EnableHexNumpad with the value of 1


Then you'll be able to enter any character by holding down the right Alt key, pressing the + button on the numeric keypad, entering the hex code, and releasing the Alt key.

You may need to log off and back on before this input type is enabled.
